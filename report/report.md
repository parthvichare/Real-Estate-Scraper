# Documentation of the Real_Estate Scraping project

# 1. Decription of the Website 
Magicbrick one of the real-estate websited in India. It provides service to buyers and sellers & rentals to search for various types of properties, including resendital,apartment, houses according to the desires states,cities

# 2. Data targeted for Scraping
In our scraping application we use to target the all prooperty listings where we scraped
carpet_area,super_area, furnishing_status,price_per_sqft, Prices of property/flats, Landmark

# 3. Challenges I faced and How I overcome through it
1. Dynamic Content Loading
MagicBricks uses dynamic content loading, where property listings and other elements are loaded asynchronously via JavaScript. This means that the data is not available immediately when the page loads,

Solution applied
I used Selenium webdriver,Explicits waits

2. Login Authetication
Access to certain data on MagicBricks required user authentication, which involved entering a username and password.

Solution
Automated the login process using Selenium by programmatically entering the username and password into the login form and submitting it. Ones we run the code first we ask user required details like mobile_number,email,password
I also implement error handling to manage login failures

3. Written code efficiently
I also implement wait times between the code to improve the efficiency of scraping through pages and cities
I faced problem while iterating process where my crawler not able to scrap whole data prooperly so to resolve the issue I implemented logic for handling error
